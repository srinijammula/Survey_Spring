# Message: `%s#%s` was mapped with explicit lazy-group (`%s`).  Hibernate will ignore the lazy-group - this is generally not a good idea for to-one associations as it would lead to 2 separate SQL selects to initialize the association.  This is expected to be improved in future versions of Hibernate
